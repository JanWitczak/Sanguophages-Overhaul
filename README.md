# Sanguophage The Overhaul

This is a mod for the game Rimworld by Ludeon Studios.

## Description
This mod adjusts Sanguophage genome, changes the way deathrest capacity is increasesed and makes hemogenpacks spoil and less nourishing.

The format of the mod's name is a cheeky reference to Vampire: The Masquerade and Vampire: The Requiem TTRPGs from which I drew inspiration.

### Genome
The basic idea is to make the Sanguophage xenotype benefits mostly confined to general resilience, with benefits like move speed and psychic aptitude being relegated to player's choice in the form of deathrest buildings. Also vampires having children was removed.
In order to give Sanguophages a clearer identity following changes to their genome are made.

Psy sensitivity and Move speed genes are removed.
Aggressive gene is increased to hyper-aggressive.
Sterile, strong stomach, reduced pain, heat super-tolerant, cold super-tolerant, and strong shooting genes are added. 

Sterility can be removed with a mod option.

### There is no cure
With the option of disabling it this mod removes the ability to "cure" a sanguophage by implanting them with any other xenogerm.

### Deathrest Capacity
Traders and factions no longer offer Deathrest Capacity Serum, the item only usable by the reviled Sanguophages. The Sanguophages Host quest can still offer it as a reward. They can however be crafted from archite capsules.

Another way of increasing deathrest capacity is vampiric cannibalism, wherein a Sanguophage consumes another Sanguophage's brain adding the victim's deathrest capacity to their own. The victim needs to be downed and of a different faction, or a prisoner.

Ready Sanguophage may implant their xenogerm into a prisoner before cannibalizing them, increasing their deathrest capacity without the need to find and contend with a hostile Sanguophage.

### Not just sanguophages
Optionally, any xenotype with deathless and deathrest genes can be considered a vampire for the purposes of cannibalism and xenotype overriding.

### Hemogen Packs
With extraction of hemogen packs being free there is no good reason to opt for direct feeding in any circumstances aside from combat, for that reason hemogen packs are made half as filling as taking blood directly.
Additionally hemogen packs are now rottable, and will be destroyed after 6 days if not refrigerated.

## Compatibility
With xenotype validation option, mods that add genes directly with have those changes reset with gene validation option.

## Savefile safety
Sanguophages generated before adding the mod will have their genes reset, retaining their deathrest capacity.
Removing the mod will not restore their genes. It can be done manually with dev mode.
